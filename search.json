Natural ()direct effects (Robins Greenland 1992; Pearl 2001) initially proposed estimands interest analyses. Natural effects defined based cross-world counterfactuals (Robins Richardson 2011) identifiability relies cross-world independence assumption. Given reliance cross-world counterfactuals, effects criticized capturing effects interventions policy measures conducted real world (Naimi, Kaufman, MacLehose 2014). , independence assumption required can never guaranteed, even experiment (Robins Richardson 2011; Didelez, Dawid, Geneletti 2006), renders estimands unidentifiable common settings exposure-induced mediator-outcome confounding multiple mediators (Avin, Shpitser, Pearl 2005; VanderWeele, Vansteelandt, Robins 2014; Vansteelandt VanderWeele 2012). However, context multiple mediators, certain path-specific natural effects, also defined terms cross-world counterfactuals, can still identified may substantive interest (VanderWeele Vansteelandt 2014). Interventional effects proposed alternative address limitations. Firstly, effects can shown map hypothetical randomized trial evaluates impact hypothetical interventions shifting distribution mediators (Moreno-Betancur Carlin 2018). Secondly, interventional effects remain identifiable presence exposure-induced mediator-outcome confounding multiple interrelated mediators interest. medRCT package implements estimation interventional effects defined explicitly effects hypothetical randomized trial (target trial) , proposed Moreno-Betancur et al. (2021). assists clarifying research question ensuring study findings meaningful relevant policy practice. target trial, treatment strategies specified reflect hypothetical interventions targeting thus shifting joint mediator distribution. medRCT package implements estimation interventional effects correspond effects hypothetical interventions : shift joint distribution mediators exposure exposure, shift distribution specific mediator exposure, given confounders, match corresponding distribution exposure, independent without considering flow-effects mediators, shift distribution specific mediator exposure, given confounders, match corresponding distribution exposure, considering flow-effects causally descendant mediators. medRCT estimates interventional effects using Monte Carlo simulation-based g-computation approach. noted method can computationally intensive sensitive model misspecification, nuisance parameters estimated via restrictive parametric models.
